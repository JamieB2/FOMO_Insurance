# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the FOMO Insurance project's visual branding and frontend references from Etherlink to Mantle network. The migration focuses exclusively on user-facing content, documentation, and frontend configuration while preserving the existing smart contract infrastructure. This change will rebrand the application to position it as a Mantle-based DeFi protocol while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the FOMO Insurance website, I want to see consistent Mantle branding throughout the application, so that I understand the protocol runs on Mantle network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the hero section SHALL display "Powered by Mantle" instead of "Powered by Etherlink"
2. WHEN a user views the "Powered by" section THEN it SHALL show Mantle logo, branding, and network benefits
3. WHEN a user reads the page content THEN all references to "Etherlink" SHALL be replaced with "Mantle"
4. WHEN a user views the FAQ section THEN all network-specific answers SHALL reference Mantle instead of Etherlink

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reading the project documentation, I want accurate information about the Mantle deployment, so that I can understand the technical foundation and network details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the README.md THEN it SHALL describe the protocol as "built on Mantle"
2. WHEN a developer views the technical overview THEN it SHALL list Mantle's benefits (high throughput, low fees, Ethereum compatibility)
3. WHEN a developer reads the roadmap THEN it SHALL reference "Mantle mainnet" deployment plans
4. WHEN a developer views network information THEN it SHALL show correct Mantle testnet details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user connecting their wallet, I want the application to reference the correct network information, so that I understand I'm interacting with Mantle network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views network indicators THEN they SHALL display "Mantle Testnet" instead of "Etherlink Testnet"
2. WHEN a user sees faucet instructions THEN they SHALL reference Mantle testnet token claiming
3. WHEN a user views explorer links THEN they SHALL point to Mantle block explorer
4. WHEN a user reads connection help text THEN it SHALL mention connecting to Mantle testnet

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the application interface, I want consistent visual branding that reflects Mantle network, so that the user experience feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page THEN the page title and metadata SHALL reference Mantle appropriately
2. WHEN a user sees network badges or indicators THEN they SHALL display Mantle branding colors and styling
3. WHEN a user views footer links THEN explorer links SHALL point to Mantle explorer
4. WHEN a user sees any network logos THEN they SHALL display Mantle logo instead of Etherlink logo

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user reading about supported tokens, I want accurate information about Mantle testnet tokens, so that I know which assets I can use with the protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads FAQ about supported tokens THEN it SHALL reference "Mantle testnet" instead of "Etherlink testnet"
2. WHEN a user views faucet page THEN it SHALL describe tokens as "for the Mantle testnet"
3. WHEN a user sees token information THEN it SHALL be contextually accurate for Mantle network
4. WHEN a user reads security information THEN it SHALL reference smart contracts on Mantle

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user accessing external resources, I want links to point to Mantle-specific resources, so that I can find relevant network information and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks explorer links THEN they SHALL navigate to Mantle block explorer
2. WHEN a user views network information THEN RPC URLs SHALL point to Mantle endpoints (if updated)
3. WHEN a user sees external documentation links THEN they SHALL reference Mantle resources where applicable
4. WHEN a user accesses help resources THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant to Mantle network
